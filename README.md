<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](#) --->

Project Leo is a Open Source inventory and Mangamnet database built that can both be run on a server (like AWS or Azure) or locally. Project leo also comes as an Desktop application which is an eacet mirror of the web UI. it runs on node.js with help from react.js and electron. the database that is used is mongodb which allows for massive datasets with the benefit of speed. 

Project Leo was a project I was working on when I was at Uni as well as working at a Lab. The current LIMS (laboratory information system) was great and allowed for eas of use but we was told to move to a very old systems that was retrofitted with new system (it didn't go down well).

Thats why this project will be free to any NHS labs that would like to use the software to intergrate with there current lab processes.

Features: 

* Intergration with Windows active directories
* Allow the use of printing of labels and blocks with no external programs required.
* Allow external customer (referring labs or doctors) to connect to see at what stage the smaple is through the lab
* HL7 support to allow communication between NHS trust
* Traditional SQL support for integration of EPR
* Full specimen tracking
* Open API to allow for export of patient details securely to other lab machines such as scanners image management systems, IHC machines. 
* Admin panel for lab mangers to grab data such as turn around times and more
* Full Audit system for UKAS complaince
* Full inventory system - Allows the printing of barcode labels to stick on reagents where user can scan each bottle and the system will keep track. 

with more features to be added in later just click on the request a feature.
